<h2><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">About -</span> </strong></span></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We provide English language editing for your journal articles, grant applications, theses, dissertations and other scientific documents. For example, this service will be useful for authors of scientific articles whose mother tongue is not English and who wish to publish their articles in English language journals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are Professors and Researchers at prestigious Universities in China and USA. Unlike most language editing companies, we are active researchers performing research and publishing in scientific journals. Please check our credentials on our professional websites (below).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We guarantee confidential handling of your documents and provide you the highest quality of service as we are all academics, scientists and researchers just like you. All editors working on your documents are a team of junior and senior researchers and Professors. They are pre-screened to provide not only the highest quality of service but are keenly aware of author's sensitivities and concerns. If you are not satisfied with our service, you may appeal to further process your document or return your payment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Importantly, we provide and encourage active interaction between the Language Editor and the Author through video (e.g. Skype). This helps the Author understand why the corrections have been made. Our goal is help improve the Author's writing skills through the services we provide.</p>
