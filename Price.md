<h2><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Pricing &amp; Processing Times -</span> </strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The charge for correcting and polishing the English language of your scientific document depends on the level of service it needs and the length of the document (in words).  Word count refers to the number of words in the text, figure and table captions. References are not included in the word count. Currently, we can accept Microsoft Word documents only. We use the word count function of this software to count the number of words in your document. The Managing Editor assigned to your document will contact you to recommend one of the following pricing levels for your document. You make the final decision.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Diamond</strong>:</span> A fixed charge of $1,500 per document (less than 10,000 words). This is submission-to-publication service. That is, the Language Editor will correct your document prior to submission to a journal. Most articles need to be revised based on peer-reviews. The Language Editor will correct your revised article plus your responses to referee's comments. If a second and third round of reviews happen, the Language Editor will continue to correct your revised article. This process ends when your article is either accepted or rejected for publication by the journal. This service is limited to one article only. You can interact with your Language Editor through out this process via video (e.g. Skype). Processing time is 5 days for each iteration.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Diamond Plus</strong>:</span> Same as Diamond service above but for documents longer than 10,000 words. The Managing Editor will negotiate a price with you prior to processing.</p>
